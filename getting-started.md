# Getting Started

You can access data in two ways. The first is to use the API, which is the most common way to access data. The second is to use the self-hosted version of the database.

## Self Hosted

Using the self-hosted version need some **technical knowledge**. The self-hosted version is a PostgreSQL database that contains all the structure, data and API. You download the database and host it on your own server or locally. This way you can access the data **without any limitations**.

The docker based source code of the self-hosted version of the database can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/Thuenen-Forest-Ecosystems/TFM-Server).

## API Requests

The API is the easiest way to access the data. You can access the  RESTful API with any programming language that supports HTTP requests. The Database and API is hosted by the Th√ºnen Institut.
