::: info
The present data basis consists of terrestrial field surveys of past inventories. Parts of it may change subsequently due to corrections for quality assurance purposes.

The data basis at the time of the extrapolations can be requested from the [Thünen Institute](https://www.thuenen.de/de/fachinstitute/waldoekosysteme).

For questions please contact bwi22-de-support(at)thuenen.de.
